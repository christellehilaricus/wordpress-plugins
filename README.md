## Image Copyrights

*Image Copyrights* is a plugin that gives you the possibility to add a copyright for each image uploaded by the Media Uploader of WordPress. Then you can use this information in your templates. There is three functions that allow you to get the copyright author or/and link.

## Person Custom Taxonomy

This plugin creates a complete administration for persons. I use it mostly for artists on music blog posts, but you can actually use it for any kind of persons/celebrities. With *Person Custom Taxonomy*, there is the possibility to inform readers about the basic information of everybody : birthdate, deathdate, real name, social links...

You can also add persons on your uploaded pictures thanks to this plugin. It also displays on your dashboard a small widget with the birthdays of the month among your persons created.

## Random Post

*Random Post* provides you a url where a post is displayed randomly. The default url is /random-post.

## Remove Useless Stuff

This is one useful widget! *Remove Useless Stuff* will help you to remove some of the stuff WordPress force you to have: the emojis provided since the version 4.2 for example, or jQuery migrate which is only necessary if a website have deprecated jQuery functions...
